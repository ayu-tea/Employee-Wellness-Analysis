# Employee Wellness & Mental Health Analysis

This project is focused on mental health in the workplace, particularly in the tech industry. I cleaned and explored a real-world dataset to uncover patterns related to treatment needs, and to understand how factors like gender, age, country, and company support affect employee wellness.

## Data Preprocessing Highlights

Hereâ€™s what I did to prepare the data for analysis:
- Standardized inconsistent values in columns like `Gender` and `No_Employees`
- Removed unrealistic age outliers (like -1726 and huge numeric errors)
- Cleaned up column names for better readability
- Visualized missing values using heatmaps
- Handled missing values using the mode or logical assumptions

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I explored questions like:
- Who is more likely to seek mental health treatment?
- How do gender and country affect workplace mental health support?
- What kind of support systems (benefits, leave policies) are available?
- How comfortable are employees discussing mental health at work?

To answer these, I visualized:
- Age distribution
- Treatment by gender and country
- Access to benefits and wellness programs
- Comfort levels with coworkers, supervisors, and interviewers
